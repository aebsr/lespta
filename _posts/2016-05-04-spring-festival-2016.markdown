Dear Laytonsville Families,

Please Help!!  We are in need of ADULT Volunteers for the 2016 Spring Festival.  Please volunteer so we do not have to cut games or activities.  If you can donate your time anywhere between 11-5 on May 21st, it would be much appreciated!  

We need you for:

- Fun Run (registration and race)
- Grillers (Setup and cooking)
- Ticket Sales
- Dunk Tank
- Snow Cone/Popcorn
- Concessions (both during the parade and during festival)
- Bake Sale (setup before festival and during)
- Silent Auction
- Floaters (designate a time you can help and we will place you)

Without your help, the Festival cannot keep going.  Thank you for your time.
